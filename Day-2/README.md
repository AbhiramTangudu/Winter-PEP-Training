Day 2 – Python Basics

On Day 2, I learned important Python concepts related to data handling and string manipulation. The topics covered include lists, the split method, the join method, and swapping variables.

Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are ordered, mutable, and can contain different types of data.

The split method is used to divide a string into a list based on a specified separator. By default, it splits a string using spaces.

The join method is used to combine a list of strings into a single string using a chosen separator.

Swapping variables means exchanging the values of two variables. Python allows swapping without using a temporary variable, making the code simple and efficient.

Day 2 helped strengthen my understanding of basic Python operations and improved my programming fundamentals.
